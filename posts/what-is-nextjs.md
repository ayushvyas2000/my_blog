If you are familiar with React then there are high chances that you have heard about NEXT.js and even if you have not, this article will help you understanding what NEXT.js is and what are the problems it solves.

# What is NEXT.js?

As the official [website](https://nextjs.org/) of NEXT.js suggests, NEXT.js is simply a *React Framework for Production* i.e. it uses React with additional features out of the box.

Using NEXT, one can build hybrid websites that use static generation as well as server side rendering which can deliver high performance websites that are scalable and SEO friendly.

## Features of NEXT.js

Just like any other framework, NEXT has many features.  Here are some of the notable ones:

- Server Side Rendering 
- Static Site Generation
- FileSystem based Routing  
- Automatic code splitting
- TypeScript support

## Why NEXT.js over plain React?

NEXT provides an easier way to switch the rendering of the webpages to the server side.  This improves the performance in terms of speed as well as **Search Engine Optimization**.  Using static site generation on webpages whose content may not change on a regular basis, we can deliver the web-pages over a CDN which will make the page loading superfast.

NEXT also comes with out of the box image optimization using the inbuilt **Image** component.

The **filesystem routing** of NEXT makes it easier to set up routes with almost negligible need of configuration.

## Who should learn NEXT.js?

If you already know React and basics of how server side code works and you want to take your development game to next level and get discovered on the internet with the SEO perks of NEXT, then what are you waiting for?
